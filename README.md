# JSProject_Catch21
This game is similar to the game show version of Catch 21 where the player can pick between 4 different slots to place cards and the goal is to reach 21 as many times as possible without going over 21. 


If a slot reaches a vaule that is greater than 21 then the slot will break/bust and the player will no longer be able to use that slot for the remainder of the game.

Special scoring is obtained when a player is able to get a slot to equal 21 with either 2, 5, or 6 cards in the slot. The user will earn 300, 400, or 450 points to the total score respectively. If the player is able to get 3 sevens in one slot the the player will earn 500 points. Otherwise if the the player gets a 21 then the points added to their score will be 200.

The player gets 3 power chips at the start of each game that allows them to play a power chip to discard the card on the deck.

Lastly the game is over if either all 4 slot have broken or all the cards in the deck have been played. If the player acheives a total score of over 1000 they will get one star, over 2000 they will get 2 stars, and over 3000 they wiil get 3 stars.
